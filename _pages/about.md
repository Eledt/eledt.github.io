Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Biostatistics at the Yale School of Public Health, working with Prof. Forastiere. My research focuses on developing methodologies for causal inference and policy evaluation, especially in settings involving clustered and network data. Currently, I am developing estimation methods for optimal treatment allocation strategies with interference among individuals.
Before joining Yale, I obtained my PhD in Economics and Finance from the University of Rome Tor Vergata, advised by Prof. Arduini.
